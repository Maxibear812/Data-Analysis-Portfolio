## About Me
Hello all, I'm Michael, though I only answer to Max. I'm a graduate of California State University, Chico with a Bachelor's of Arts in English Studies, and a budding self-taught analyst looking to break into the big data industry. 

I completed the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate in April of this year (2024) and have been building my portfolio with analysis projects, which I will be posting in here to keep the public updated on my road to becoming a full time Data Analyst. 

Most of my analysis education has been completed in R, though I have minor experience with Data Analysis in Excel / Google Sheets, Tableau, and SQL. I plan to expand my skillset to include Python and Power BI in the future.
