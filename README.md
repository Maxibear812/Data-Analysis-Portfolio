## About Me

Hello all, I'm Michael (He/Him), though I only answer to Max. 

I'm an Operations Specialist for Acensus LLC, a graduate of California State University, Chico with a Bachelor of Arts in English Studies, and a budding self-taught analyst looking to jump start my career as a data analyst.

I completed the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate in April of this year (2024) and have been building my portfolio with analysis projects since. I will be posting said projects here to keep the public updated on my road to becoming a full-time data analyst.

Most of my analysis education has been completed in R, and I have intermediate experience with Data Analysis in Excel / Google Sheets, Tableau, and SQL. 

I am expanding my skill set to include SQL, Python, and Power BI as I complete projects.

Lastly, I have over 8 years of Customer Service experience in varying service industries, both on-site and remote, and 2 years of operations experience in the retirement industry. See my LinkedIn profile for more details.

## Projects

I've listed out some data analysis projects used to solve fictional business tasks. 

[Cyclistic Ridership Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/code/maxwelltucker/cyclistic-ridership-analysis) 
[Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/maxwelltucker/cyclistic-ridership-analysis)

Goal: To determine the differences in ride data for different categories of customers that use a bike rental service.

Description: The project analyzed two years' worth of ridership data from 2019-2020 to determine differences in repeated customers ("Members") and occasional customers ("Casual") usage of the fictional bicycle rental service, Cyclistic (based on the real-life company Divvy's data). The data included ride start/end times/locations, PII information (gender, age), and a mixed bag of statistics related to ride data. 

[Dr. Semmelweis Handwashing Analysis](https://github.com/Maxibear812/Dr.-Semmelweis-Handwashing-Analysis)
- [Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/maxwelltucker/dr-semmelweis-handwashing-analysis-in-r/notebook)

Goal: To analyze the impact of Dr. Semmelweis's handwashing discovery on the medical industry's birth-to-death ratios.

Description: This project will examine the monthly and yearly historical data collected by Dr. Semmelweis on maternal mortality rates in hospitals with and without handwashing practices. By comparing these rates, the analysis will quantify the historical impact and overall effectiveness of handwashing as a preventive measure against infectious diseases in healthcare settings.

I've set this analysis against a fictional hospital administration's business objective to promote Hand Hygiene Awareness Week. This fictional event aims to educate patients, guests, and facility staff on the critical importance of handwashing in preventing infections and improving patient safety.

[Airbnb Market Trends](https://github.com/Maxibear812/AirBnB-Market-Trend-Analysis-Project)
- [Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/maxwelltucker/airbnb-market-trend-analysis-project/edit)

Goal: To analyze the short-term rental market in New York and identify any market trends relevant to the real estate's business objectives. 

Description: As my current project, I'll be acting as a fictional consultant by analyzing market trends for a real estate startup, who have generously collected Airbnb listing data from various sources. I will upload the completed project soon.
