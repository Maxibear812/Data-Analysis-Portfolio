## About Me
Hello all, I'm Michael, though I only answer to Max. I'm a graduate of California State University, Chico with a Bachelor's of Arts in English Studies, and a budding self-taught analyst looking to break into the big data industry. 

I completed the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate in April of this year (2024) and have been building my portfolio with analysis projects, which I will be posting in here to keep the public updated on my road to becoming a full time Data Analyst. 

Most of my analysis education has been completed in R, though I have minor experience with Data Analysis in Excel / Google Sheets, Tableau, and SQL. I plan to expand my skillset to include Python and Power BI in the future.

## Portfolio Projects
I've listed out some data analysis projects used to solve fictional business tasks. 

### Cyclistic Ridership Analysis
**Code:** []

**Goal:** To determine the differences in ride data for different categories of customers that use a bike rental service. 

**Description:** The project analyzed two years worth of ridership data from 2019-2020 to determine differences in repeated users ("members") and occassional users ("casual"). The data included ride start/end times/locations, 


### Dr. Semmelweis Handwashing Analysis
**Code:** []

**Goal:** To analyze the impact of Dr. Semmelweis's handwashing discovery on the medical industry's birth-to-death ratios.

**Description:** This project will examine the monthly and yearly historical data collected by Dr. Semmelweis on maternal mortality rates in hospitals with and without handwashing practices. By comparing these rates, the analysis will quantify the historical impact and overall effectiveness of handwashing as a preventive measure against infectious diseases in healthcare settings. 

I've set this analysis against a fictional hospital administration's business objective to promote Hand Hygiene Awareness Week. This fictional event aims to educate patients, guests, and facility staff on the critical importance of handwashing to prevent infections and improve patient safety.
