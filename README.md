## About Me

Hello all, I'm Michael (He/Him), though I only answer to Max. 

I'm an Operations Specialist for Acensus LLC, a graduate of California State University, Chico with a Bachelor of Arts in English Studies, and a budding self-taught analyst looking to break into the big data industry.

I completed the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate in April of this year (2024) and have been building my portfolio with analysis projects, which I will be posting here to keep the public updated on my road to becoming a full-time Data Analyst.

Most of my analysis education has been completed in R, and I have intermediate experience with Data Analysis in Excel / Google Sheets, Tableau, and SQL. 

I am expanding my skill set to include SQL, Python, and Power BI as I complete projects.

Lastly, I have over 8 years of Customer Service experience in varying service industries, both on-site and remote, and 2 years of operations experience in the retirement industry. See my LinkedIn profile for more details.

## Projects

I've listed out some data analysis projects used to solve fictional business tasks.

Cyclistic Ridership Analysis
Code: []

Goal: To determine the differences in ride data for different categories of customers that use a bike rental service.

Description: The project analyzed two years' worth of ridership data from 2019-2020 to determine differences in repeated users ("Members") and occasional users ("Casual"). The data included ride start/end times/locations,

[Dr. Semmelweis Handwashing Analysis](https://github.com/Maxibear812/Dr.-Semmelweis-Handwashing-Analysis)
- [Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/maxwelltucker/dr-semmelweis-handwashing-analysis-in-r/notebook)

Goal: To analyze the impact of Dr. Semmelweis's handwashing discovery on the medical industry's birth-to-death ratios.

Description: This project will examine the monthly and yearly historical data collected by Dr. Semmelweis on maternal mortality rates in hospitals with and without handwashing practices. By comparing these rates, the analysis will quantify the historical impact and overall effectiveness of handwashing as a preventive measure against infectious diseases in healthcare settings.

I've set this analysis against a fictional hospital administration's business objective to promote Hand Hygiene Awareness Week. This fictional event aims to educate patients, guests, and facility staff on the critical importance of handwashing to prevent infections and improve patient safety.
